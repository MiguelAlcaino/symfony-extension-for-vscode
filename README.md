# Symfony extension for Visual Studio Code
Extension for VS Code that understands your Symfony Code.

This extension is aimed for people who use PHPStorm with the Symfony plugin but want to migrate to Visual Studio Code.

During the following days I will create the skeleton of the extension and it will be open to receive pull requests.
